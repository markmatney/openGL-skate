# openGL-skate
Skateboarding animation written in C++, using OpenGL.

I submitted this assignment for CS 174A, Intro to Computer Graphics, UCLA Spring 2014

You can see a video of the animation here:

It was chosen as one of the top 20 animations from a class of 80 students:

The code is not quite working right now. I developed it on a Windows machine, and am having trouble porting it to my GNU/Linux box (about a year later, at that).
